# Personal Project: Fit-Foodie

## Diet Tracker Application

- This program is like a **food ledger**. It provides a platform for users to **record their everyday eating habits**, and they can use the built-in options to record the food they eat every day and its calories.
  This application **evaluates the user's nutritional intake for the day** based on the food intake entered by the user as well as the height and weight entered by the user. 



- Anyone who wants to keep track of their eating habits, such as the need to control their dietary intake for fitness, can use this app.



- People today are becoming more and more conscious of their appearance, and many may even go on excessive diets in pursuit of a single aesthetic leading to an increase in body burden. This application evaluates the user's nutritional intake and can **helps the user to build a more healthy diet based on their body condition**, instead of pursuing an extreme diet that doesn't fit their own condition.
